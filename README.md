# Tetra-Square-Symmetries
Exploration of permutations of objects with 4 vertices

While studying abstract algebra I became interested in the permutations of shapes and objects with 4 vertices. To further explore the nature of these permutations I wrote this application to quickly calculate the various sets involved.

The main curiosity of the project was the transform like quality of converting a square to a tetrahedron and back using the permutation list.

The ability to transform from 2 to 3 dimensions and back again is an interesting property and this admittedly naive introduction to symmentries requires significantly more investigation.
